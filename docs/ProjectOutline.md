# ClutterBase

Start with design and rationale

- portable
- usable in all DCC
- simple schema / file format
- stand alone PyQt
- TDD / BDD?

# Step 1

Next design the database and schema

Build simple demo using scripts / assets
Get some online assets (think from pixar)
Support perhaps Obj, FBX and USD for now (use assimp)

Build simple database and see what size is.

Add images and search queries


# Step 2

Buid stand alone PyQt / PySide Gui (decide which to use and why)
Simple to start with (new DB), add simple assets (make comand line tools as well?)

# Step 3 

integrate into Maya
start simple then build UI

# Step 3 

integrate into Houdini

# Step 4 

integrate into Blender and perhaps Nuke?
